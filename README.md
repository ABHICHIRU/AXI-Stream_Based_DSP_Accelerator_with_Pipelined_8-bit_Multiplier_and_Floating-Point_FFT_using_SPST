High-Performance 8-bit Multipliers & Floating-Point FFT with Pipelining and SPST Optimization
üìå Overview

This repository contains multiple 8-bit multiplier architectures and an optional advanced 8-point FFT block, all implemented in Verilog HDL, optimized for low power and high speed using:

‚úÖ Wallace Tree Multiplier (Fast parallel reduction)
‚úÖ Array Multiplier (Simple structured design)
‚úÖ Booth Multiplier (Signed multiplication support)
‚úÖ Vedic Multiplier (Based on Urdhva Tiryakbhyam algorithm)
‚úÖ 8-Point FFT Block with IEEE-754 Floating-Point Operations

Each design supports:

‚úî 3-Stage Pipelining for high operating frequency
‚úî SPST (Spurious Power Suppression Technique) for low-power optimization by skipping unnecessary computations

‚ö° Pipelining & SPST

Stage 1: Input Latching

Stage 2: Partial Product or Butterfly Calculation

Stage 3: Final Addition & Output

SPST: Skips multiplication if one operand = 0 ‚Üí reduces dynamic power.
