ðŸ”¢ Digital Multiplier Implementations in Cadence
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains the design and implementation of four different multiplier architectures using Cadence Virtuoso and related EDA tools. The multipliers implemented are:

Array Multiplier

Wallace Tree Multiplier

Booth Multiplier

Vedic Multiplier

The project compares these architectures in terms of speed, power consumption, and area utilization, providing insights into their suitability for low-power and high-performance VLSI systems.
