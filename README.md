High-Performance 8-bit Multipliers & Floating-Point FFT with Pipelining and SPST Optimization
📌 Overview

This repository contains multiple 8-bit multiplier architectures and an optional advanced 8-point FFT block, all implemented in Verilog HDL, optimized for low power and high speed using:

✅ Wallace Tree Multiplier (Fast parallel reduction)
✅ Array Multiplier (Simple structured design)
✅ Booth Multiplier (Signed multiplication support)
✅ Vedic Multiplier (Based on Urdhva Tiryakbhyam algorithm)
✅ 8-Point FFT Block with IEEE-754 Floating-Point Operations

Each design supports:

✔ 3-Stage Pipelining for high operating frequency
✔ SPST (Spurious Power Suppression Technique) for low-power optimization by skipping unnecessary computations

🚀 Features

Multiple Architectures: Compare Wallace, Array, Booth, and Vedic multipliers.

IEEE-754 Floating-Point FFT Block: Unrolled, pipelined design for DSP.

Complex Number Support: Handles both real and imaginary inputs for FFT.

Custom Floating-Point Unit: Includes addition, subtraction, and multiplication logic in Verilog.

Pipelined Design: Three stages for better timing performance.

SPST Gating: Saves power when inputs contain zeros.

4. Vedic Multiplier

Based on Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra.

Produces results in parallel.

Includes SPST and pipelining for low power.

5. 8-Point FFT Block (Advanced)

Fully Unrolled FFT: All stages expanded, no loops.

IEEE-754 Floating-Point Support:

⚡ Pipelining & SPST

Stage 1: Input Latching

Stage 2: Partial Product or Butterfly Calculation

Stage 3: Final Addition & Output

SPST: Skips multiplication if one operand = 0 → reduces dynamic power.
