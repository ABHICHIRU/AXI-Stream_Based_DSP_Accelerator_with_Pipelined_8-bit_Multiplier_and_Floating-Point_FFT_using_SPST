AXI-Stream Based DSP Accelerator with Pipelined 8-bit Multiplier and Floating-Point FFT using SPST Optimization
A high-performance, synthesizable RTL design that integrates 8-bit integer multipliers and a floating-point FFT block with pipelining, SPST (Single-Pulse Single-Transfer) optimization, and a fully AXI-Stream compatible handshake protocol.

This project builds on previous DSP accelerator concepts to achieve:

High throughput and low latency digital signal processing

Efficient power optimization using SPST technique that disables unused logic dynamically

AXI-Stream handshake interface for seamless streaming data transfer suitable for FPGA and ASIC design flows

Full compatibility with Cadence Genus synthesis and implementation tools

Overview
This repository demonstrates a pipelined DSP accelerator that interoperates the following components:

8-bit high-speed integer multipliers to handle fixed-point multiplication

Floating-point FFT computation engine, pipelined for throughput

AXI-stream handshake interface for robust and backpressure-aware data streaming

SPST optimization which applies power reduction by gating inactive sections of logic

Its architecture and handshake controls make it easy to integrate the accelerator into wider SoC or FPGAs.

Key Features
✅ Fully compliant AXI-Stream Valid/Ready handshake

✅ Pipelined design for near one-sample-per-cycle throughput

✅ SPST power optimization for reduced dynamic power

✅ Synthesizable Verilog RTL, suitable for FPGA/ASIC

✅ Verified with testbenches and waveform analysis

✅ Cadence Genus compatible synthesis scripts included

            Handshake Logic on Input and Output
The multiplier and FFT core are tightly integrated with pipeline stages.

Handshake logic governs flow control based on AXI-Stream protocol.

AXI Handshake Protocol
The design implements the AXI-Stream valid/ready handshake:

Input signals: tvalid, tready, tdata

Output signals: tvalid, tready, tdata

Operation:

Input source asserts tvalid when data is ready.

DSP accelerator asserts tready when able to accept data.

Data transfers only when both tvalid and tready are high.

Backpressure supported: when tready is low, upstream holds data.

File Structure

Usage Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/ABHICHIRU/AXI-Stream_Based_DSP_Accelerator_with_Pipelined_8-bit_Multiplier_and_Floating-Point_FFT_using_SPST_O.git
cd AXI-Stream_Based_DSP_Accelerator_with_Pipelined_8-bit_Multiplier_and_Floating-Point_FFT_using_SPST_O
Synthesize with Cadence Genus:

Update synthesis TCL scripts if necessary with correct paths.

Run:

tcl
source scripts/rcscript_slow.tcl   # For max timing with slow library
# or
source scripts/rcscript_fast.tcl   # For min timing with fast library
Run simulation using the testbench in tb/ with your preferred simulator.

Reports & Results
Timing, power, and area reports are generated by the synthesis scripts.

Waveform analysis confirms data and handshake accuracy.

Performance benchmarks show throughput and latency improvements.

Performance Benchmarks
Pending full FPGA implementation, early results show:

Near 1 sample per cycle throughput

Significant power savings from SPST gating

Scalable FFT length and configurable multiplier precision under development

Future Work
Support for larger FFT sizes (256, 512, 1024 points)

Integration of AXI4-Lite control registers

Clock gating and further power reduction techniques

Full FPGA implementation results with resource utilization
